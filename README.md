# git-poule
Just a funny french word game for git pull

** Steps to install **

1- Install cowsay (apt-get install cowsay on debian-like).
2- Copy the poule.cow file in the cows folder of cowsay (ex.:/usr/share/cowsay/cows/).
3- Copy the script poule.sh alongside the chicken.wav file (or modify the script to point to the right path of the chicken.wav). In the $HOME/bin/ folder.
4- Add the alias of the git command contained in the gitconfig file into your own .gitconfig.
5- If you want a shortcut, creat an alias poule="git poule" into your .bashrc

6- Enjoy the chicken pulling your git changes...
